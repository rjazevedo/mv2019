This year, we are asking for individual registration and payments. World Finalists and Brazilian Medalists are will not pay the registration fee. Brazilian Computer Society Members will get 20% discount on registration. You can get some discount if you opt to register to SBC during the school registration process (there is no auto-renewal requirement).
